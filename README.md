The goal of the game is to get as far as you can.
you have to puch ice across the floor. to keep up your speed avoid debris.
in order to move ice push it with your mouse.
the bigger the ice the less speed it loses over time.
once you get too small or too slow, your taken to the score screen where you can buy upgrades.
you get more money the farther you go.
there isnt an end programmed into the game.
